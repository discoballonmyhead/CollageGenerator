- **Image Scaling**: Adjust the scaling factor to increase the image size before processing.
- **Chunk Size Selection**: Choose the size of the chunks to divide the image.
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Uses TensorFlow.js and MobileNet to find the best matching icons based on detailed pixel analysis.
- **Downloadable Mosaics**: Download the final mosaic image after processing.
- **Responsive UI**: The application remains responsive during processing with visual feedback.
